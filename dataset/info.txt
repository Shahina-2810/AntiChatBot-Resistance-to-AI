# Dataset for Bot Detection

This directory contains the datasets used for training and testing the bot detection machine learning model.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset consists of the following components:

1. **Mouse Movement Data**: Trajectories, velocities, and patterns of mouse movements from both human and bot interactions.
2. **Keyboard Input Data**: Typing patterns, speeds, and rhythms from human and automated inputs.
3. **Session Behavior Data**: Navigation patterns, page interaction times, and session characteristics.
4. **Form Interaction Data**: How forms are filled, submission patterns, and error handling behaviors.

## Data Collection Methodology

The data was collected through:

- Controlled experiments with known human users
- Simulated bot interactions using various bot frameworks
- Real-world website interactions with consent-based tracking
- Labeled datasets from security research partners

## Data Format

Each record in the dataset contains:

- Timestamp
- Event type (mouse move, click, key press, etc.)
- Event details (coordinates, key pressed, etc.)
- Session identifier
- Label (human or bot)
- Confidence score of the label

## Usage

This dataset is used to train the machine learning model located in the `models/` directory. The model is trained to distinguish between human and bot interactions based on behavioral patterns.

## Privacy Considerations

All data has been anonymized and contains no personally identifiable information. The dataset focuses solely on interaction patterns rather than content or personal data.
